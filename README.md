# A modified build of OpenELEC for AMD CPUs

[OpenELEC](http://www.openelec.tv) runs [XBMC](http://xbmc.org), an award-winning free and open source (GPL) software media 
player and entertainment hub for digital media. For more info see http://xbmc.org .
The base system has been designed and built from the ground up to be as 
efficient as possible â€“ consuming only tiny disk and memory footprints and
providing cutting edge hardware support to deliver a set-top box experience.

The aim of this build is to streamline OpenELEC further for machines using AMD chipsets, and to include files
necessary for an all-in-one home entertainment system, including audio and video streaming, gaming and customised
XBMC skins and settings.
